    "In this tutorial series, you'll have the unique opportunity to learn about galaxies using real data from the RESOLVE survey, collected from professional class instruments and observatories across the world. This first tutorial introduces the concept of a galaxy -- in particular, their compositions and sizes. You'll use a computer programming language called \"Python\" to examine the data. Python is a general-purpose programming language but is used by professional scientists and astronomers worldwide.\n",

Evidence of dark matter was first discovered by [Dr. Vera Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Rubin) in 1980, although it was proposed decades earlier by [Fritz Zwicky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Zwicky).

    "Galaxies are enormous systems of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter. They are generally tens-of-thousands of light years across. Our solar system is orbiting in the Milky Way galaxy along with hundreds of billions of other stars. If the Milky Way were a sandbox, then our solar system would be just a single grain of sand in that vast space. Our galaxy is about 106,000 light-years across, but galaxies come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors. The next tutorial -- \"Galaxies and their Different Flavors\" -- will explore the different families of galaxies based on their colors and physical characteristics. \n",

    "1) Of the 25 galaxies on the webpage, the most prominent bar is in J115537.91-004615.5 (3rd image on 3rd row). The galaxy J172343.2+570025.1 also has a bar (lower left image).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) There are $10^{41}$ kg of hydrogen and each atom has a mass of $10^{-27}$ kg, so the number of atoms is $10^{41}/10^{-27} = 10^{68}$ atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) For a galaxy whose stellar mass is $10^{10.5}$ solar masses, the dark matter halo mass will be roughly $10^{12}$ - $10^{12.5}$ (about 1 trillion) solar masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Google says that one light year is equal to about 5.9 trillion miles. What a road trip that would be!\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The mean radius is 24,000 light years, whereas the median is only 16,500. This is a consequence of the fact that distribution is \"skewed\" --- it is not symmetrical since the right side of it is much longer than the left side.\n",
