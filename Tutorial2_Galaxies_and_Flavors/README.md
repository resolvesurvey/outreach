# Tutorial #2: Galaxies and their Different Flavors

In the second tutorial of this series, you will use the Python programming language and the RESOLVE survey database to answer some fundamental questions about galaxies:
* What types of galaxies are there?
* What is the relationship between galaxy color and galaxy mass?
* What is the relationship between galaxy color and galaxy shape?
* Can there be outliers in these relationships?
