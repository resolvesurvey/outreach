For this groundbreaking discovery, Rubin has been honored with many scientific awards, such as the National Medal of Science. She is also the namesake of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a new telescope that is designed to study dark matter and dark energy throughout the Universe.\n",

    "## (4) A Search for Dark Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Rubin's work has inspired decades of experiments to probe what dark matter is and how it might work. Physicists and astronomers are still searching for answers, but here are three possibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### (a) Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOS)\n",
    "\n",
    "One early hypothesis postulated that dark matter is not actually an undiscovered or exotic type of matter, but rather just consists of ordinary matter that is too faint to see. Such MACHOs might be in the form of black holes, neutron stars, or brown dwarf stars orbiting in the halo of the Milky Way. A search called the MACHOs Project was undertaken in the 1990s, which found that only 20% or less of the Milky Way's dark matter could be in the form MACHOs. Thus, while MACHOs may partly explain the dark matter mystery, it is not sufficient by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (b) Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another hypothesis for dark matter is weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a new and undiscovered type of fundamental subatomic particle (like quarks and electrons). To explain dark matter, these particles would need masses greater than the proton mass and interact only gravitationally, not electromagnetically, since dark matter does not interact with light. In a fundamental physics theory called \"supersymmetry,\" WIMPs are predicted in abundance and have just the right mass to explain the dark matter problem. But unfortunately, dedicated experiments on instruments like XENON1T and the Large Hadron Collider have not yet found these WIMPs. WIMPs remain a leading candidate to explain dark matter, but the jury is still out.\n",

    "## (5) Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotation curves -- the mathematical relationship between rotation speed and orbital radius -- represent a fundamental way that astronomers are able to measure the mass distribution in galaxies. In this tutorial, we followed the work of astronomer Vera Rubin and her discovery that spiral galaxy rotation curves are not Keplerian; rather, they are flat. With the test case of RESOLVE galaxy `rs0916`, you used a rotation curve to show that dark matter dominates over ordinary matter (gas and stars) in this galaxy at a ratio of nearly 9:1. Finally, we discussed ongoing experiments to detect candidates for this mysterious dark matter, including MACHOs, WIMPs, and axions. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Jupiter's moons follow the same equation as the planets orbiting the Sun, just with Jupiter's mass instead of the Sun's mass at the center of the orbits. Solving $v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$ for the dominant central mass $M$ we get $M=v^2r/G$. Mass of Jupiter: $M = (10900\\,{\\rm m/s})^2 (1.07\\times10^9{\\rm\\,m}) \\,/\\,(6.67\\times10^{-11}{\\rm N\\,m^2\\,kg^{-2}}) = 10877\\,{\\rm m/s} = 1.9 \\times 10^{27}\\,\\rm kg$. Note that we converted km to meters before plugging into the equation; also, we used $1{\\rm N}=1{\\rm kg\\,m\\,/\\,s^2}$. We would get the same answer using any moon of Jupiter -- the further-out moons would have lower orbital speeds so the mass of Jupiter would always come out the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Re-arranging equation yields $M(R) = \\frac{v(R)^2 G}{R}$. After substituting this equation into the code cell, the total mass of the simulated galaxy is $73.7 \\times 10^9\\, M_\\odot$. The rotation curve of the galaxy doesn't fall off as fast as the rotation curve of the Solar System because almost all the mass in the Solar System is in a point in the middle (the Sun), whereas as you go out from the center of a galaxy $M(R)$ keeps growing at first, then tapers off so you see the same falloff in the outer galaxy rotation curve as for the Solar System.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) The ordinary matter (stars and gas) comprise 6.7 billion solar masses while the dark matter comprises 65.7 billion. Thus, the percentage of ordinary matter in `rs0916` is $\\frac{6.7}{65.7}\\times 100\\% = 10.2\\%$. The remaining \"dark matter\" is apparent because instead of falling, the `rs0916` rotation curve keeps rising, meaning even at large radii the rotation curve never gets beyond most of the galaxy's mass as it did in the falling part of the model galaxy rotation curve."
