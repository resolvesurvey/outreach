# Tutorial 3: The Mystery of Dark Matter

In the third tutorial of this series, you will use the Python programming language and RESOLVE survey data to explore the mystery of dark matter. The questions you will answer include:
* What can a "rotation curve" tell astronomers about the mass of an object?
* Who was Vera Rubin?
* What did Vera Rubin discover about the mass make-up in galaxies?
* Do all galaxies share the same rotation curve, and what does that mean about dark matter?
* What might dark matter be made of?
