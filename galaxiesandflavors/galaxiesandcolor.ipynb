Those created stars then stay in the same disky shape. Spheroidal galaxies can often arise from stars born in gas that is not is an ordered disky structure.

    "1) The answer is 1638, since we count starting from 0 and it goes up to 1637.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) `resolve['color']`. Fun fact, if you want to see all of the parameters that are available in a dataframe called `resolve`, then you can type `resolve.columns`. I've left an empty coding cell below for you to test this out. Feel free to try and look at other parameters in the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Going from log stellar mass of 6 to linear units would be $10^6$, or one million solar masses. From there, since we know there are $2 * 10^{30}$ kilograms in a solar mass, the stellar mass would be $10^6 * (2 * 10^{30}$) = $2 * 10^{36}$ kilograms. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) The correct answer is redder galaxies. Red galaxies have a higher number while blue galaxies have a lower color number.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **the answer to this question is essentially given in the text above**, but disk galaxies are mostly found in the blue cloud while spheroidal galaxies are found in the red sequence. Recall that disk galaxies includes mainly spiral galaxies and spheroidal galaxies are often called elliptical galaxies. There are also some galaxies that have disks but also have a spheroid in its center as well. This makes classification tricky and I believe it's best to think of galaxies as being on a spectrum that ranges from completely disky to completely spheroidal. "
