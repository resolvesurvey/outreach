## List of Tutorials
All of our tutorials are written in interative Jupyter Notebook format using the Python programming language. However, our tutorials require no background knowledge of computer programming or astronomy. They are written for non-experts, and they are appropriate for high school or college students. We recommend completing the tutorials in order.

 1. "What is a Galaxy?" - overview of the sizes and compositions of galaxies, our place in the Milky Way.
 2. "Galaxies and their Different Flavors" - exploration of the basic categories of galaxies, plus their colors and shapes.
