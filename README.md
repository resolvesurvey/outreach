# RESOLVE Outreach Tutorials

## Binder Link
To complete a tutorial from the list below, visit our [Binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/resolvesurvey/outreach/HEAD). Then choose the tutorial folder in the left-hand side menu, and click on the notebook (e.g., folder `Tutorial1_What_is_a_Galaxy` and then `WhatIsAGalaxy.ipynb`). This can take up to a few minutes to load as it converts the tutorials into an easy-to-use layout on a new webpage. If it fails or times-out, re-running it will usually be successful.

## List of Tutorials
All of our tutorials are written in interative Jupyter Notebook format using the Python programming language. However, our tutorials require no background knowledge of computer programming or astronomy. They are written for non-experts, and they are appropriate for high school or college students. We recommend completing the tutorials in order.

 1. "What is a galaxy?" - overview of the sizes and compositions of galaxies, our place in the Milky Way.
 2. "Galaxies and their Different Flavors" - exploration of the basic categories of galaxies, plus their colors and shapes.
 3. "The Mystery of Dark Matter" - investigation into galaxy rotation curves, the scientific achievements of Vera Rubin, and the discovery of dark matter
